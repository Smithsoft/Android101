An introductory JavaScript workshop for beginners.

This workshop is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site.

It is hosted using Github Pages, so the content is in the `gh-pages` branch, not `master`.

To build the workshop locally:

1. Install ruby (v2) if you donâ€™t already have it
2. Install bundler: `gem install bundler`
3. make sure you are in the `gh-pages` branch
4. Install dependencies: `bundle install` 
5. Run Jekyll: `jekyll serve -L`
