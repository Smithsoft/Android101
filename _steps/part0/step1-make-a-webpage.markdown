OK, you now have a functioning setup.  Let's take it for a spin.

Just to check your Android Studio setup actually worked and to get started on
learning to navigate Android projects we'll create a project.

# Creating An Android Project

Follow this walk-through to get the paint-by-numbers version of how to create the project.

After you've created the project and the code is displaying Android Studio will
grind its gears for quite a while as beneath the surface all its tooling processes

around the IDE a number of indicators of progress bars & network downloads.

You'll need to wait for this to conclude before doing much with your new project.

* Show Members
* Autoscroll to Source
